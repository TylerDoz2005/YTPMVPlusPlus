## YTPMV++ is an iteration of [YTPMV+](https://github.com/philosophofee/YTPPlus), written in C#.
### It includes new features and benefits over the previous iteration, such as:

  - Intro and outro, with toggles
  - Setting width/height for rendered videos
  - Includes FFMPEG and FFPROBE
  - Error handling
  - [Plugin support](https://github.com/YTP-Plus/YTPPlusPlus/wiki/Plugin-Creation)

## A warning call
For those of you using plugins, please be aware that YTP++ has no mind in what is a real plugin batch and what isn't. Any non-verified plugins have the potential to be malicious, be on the look out for the malicious use of plugins as there is a possibility that a plugin can be harmful. Remember to **NEVER** start YTP++ as an administrator.

## What is YTPMV+ and YTPMV++?
YTP+ is the name given to a set of tools to automatically generate machinima-like videos.
YTP++ is the name given to the second iteration of the software, however there was once a [YTP++ made in Electron and Node.JS](https://github.com/TeamPopplio/ytpplus-node-ui).

## How do I configure YTPMV++?
All configuration settings may be found in the application itself, either on the interface or in the Tools menu. [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/) is required for the Squidward effect but is otherwise not needed.
A 32-bit version of [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/) is recommended to run this software, please install it beforehand for enhanced functionality.

## I can't run YTPMV++, it just blinks and dissapears!
Try installing the [.NET Framework 4.7.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net472) or newer runtime. Please note that YTP++ does not currently run on Windows Vista or below and has only been tested under Windows 10.

## I installed VLC, but it's still giving me an error?
Make sure it is the **32-bit** version of VLC as the 64-bit one will not work unless you select it manually.

## I installed ImageMagick, but Squidward is still disabled?
Try adding magick.exe to your system path. If you've checked the box needed in the installation prompt for ImageMagick, try restarting your computer. If all else fails, try setting magick.exe manually via the Tools menu.

## I got a great idea for the program, where to start?
Anyone is welcome to submit a pull request or suggest ideas via the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/bzhzRmg).

## The YTPMV+ Project
The [YTP+ project](https://ytp-plus.github.io/) is an ongoing effort to automatically generate machinimas. Anyone can contribute by forking a YTP+ related repository and expanding upon the goal. This software is apart of the project as well.
